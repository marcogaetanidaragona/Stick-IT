# Stick-IT
Matlab codes to generate the OpenSees Stick-IT model in OpenSees


The Stick-IT model is a multi-degree of freedom system consisting of a series of lumped masses connected in series by means of nonlinear shear link elements that allows the prediction of the nonlinear building response in terms of Interstory Drift Ratios and Peak Floor Accelerations. Based on the analysis of a large database of Gravity load-designed buildings, Gaetani d’Aragona et al.(2020) have suitably calibrated the nonlinear shear springs (envelope curves and hysteretic rules) of the Stick-IT model to simulate the behavior of infilled RC building typologies. The model has been demonstrated to efficiently describe the nonlinear behavior and failure modes in multistory buildings properly capturing the damage concentration and evolution in each story under earthquake loadings.
